# PromptPay QR Generator

A simple, client-side web application to generate Thai PromptPay QR codes for various payment scenarios. This tool is built with plain HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript, making it lightweight and easy to deploy.

## ‚ú® Features

This web app provides three main functionalities:

1.  **Create QR for Payment:** Generate a QR code for a specific amount. Ideal for invoicing or requesting a fixed payment from a buyer.
2.  **Create QR for Receiving Funds:** Generate a static QR code without a pre-filled amount. Perfect for sellers, merchants, or receiving donations where the payer specifies the amount.
3.  **Split the Bill:** A handy utility for groups. Enter the total bill amount and the number of people, and the app calculates the amount per person, generating a specific QR code for that share. This makes it easy to collect money from friends.

**Other Features:**

* **Download QR Code:** Easily save the generated QR code as a PNG image.
* **Responsive Design:** Works smoothly on both desktop and mobile browsers.
* **No Backend Required:** Runs entirely in the browser, ensuring privacy and simplicity.
